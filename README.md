# Practice-Coding
Some of the various problems that I generally do solve to both improve my programming skills and to stay in touch. Most of the questions are either from "www.hackerrank.com", "www.coderbyte.com", and a rare few from "www.codechef.com".

Most of the code works, however, there are some questions that are not compeletely answered, either because I found a better idea and implemented it in a different file, or because I got bored/pissed and dropped it. The file name will contain a general idea of what the question is about, and the code has the question commented along with it.

Cheers
